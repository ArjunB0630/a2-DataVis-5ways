# d3

d3 is a javascript library that helps with making effective data driven visualizations which is exactly what this project needs. THere is a lot of svg use, and it is cool to see what we used primarly in the project 1, is prominently used in d3. Overall to visualize the dataset, I used d3.csv to accomplish the task and createed an accruate depiction of the graph needed. Although d3 sucessfully gave me a perfect visuzaliation, I think it took way too much time, compared to some other tools we could be useing.

#Altair

Altair was fun, and it was really great to work with python, and create build in libraries like pandas. we used things like alt.chart() and mark_circle() to accomplsih my tasks. We mapped the corresponding units in the csv file. Although this method was way more fun, I think opening the html file is a little more annoying than the previous d3, however, I do like fact that we use python and the code was much shorter in this context.

#r-ggplot

r-ggplot was easier than the other two for sure. In this implementation, we used R, and it works as well as python and js. There were some problems in the begignin gwith the background and colors for the graph. Once I changed some of the details under geom point, the description makes more sense and the graph looks more similar to the original preseented in the assignment. Overall I think that r-ggplot was good and was probably the easiest to implement versus the other two.


#excel
Excel was extremely simple. I spent time working on implementing the specific charts to the scatter plot. Excel is great, because it easily points you out to the correct areas and what to do to optimize a graph. I feel like it was harder to use the data in excel compared to the other ones Ive used. However, the interface is very simple but the data could definetly be used more in order tools.


#Vega-Lite

Vega-Lite was a new and intersting way to visual data which ive never heard before. It incorporated the use of json files, which was different from the previous tools used. The flipper length, species, and the bill length were optimized for size and realiability. One thing I found difficult, was trying to actually visualize the data on the Vega-Lite code editor for github. It is very tough to implement the schema. Overall although this was a fun solution to implement, it is defintely not the most optimal and in the future, I wouldnt go with this as the first option.
